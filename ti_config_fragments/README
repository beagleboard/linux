			     TI defconfig Fragments

Description
===========

The Linux kernel contains a script that takes a base defconfig and merges
defconfig fragment files into a final buildable configuration for your target.

TI Defconfig Merge Script Usage
===============================

1.0 Script contents
-------------------

This script will either take in a single defconfig fragment file or a file with
multiple fragments defined.  With either file the base defconfig will initially
be built, copied to a working directory, and the kernels merge_config script
will be called for each config file fragment.  Each config file fragment will
be appended to the base config and then the final output will be copied back to
the kernels working directory.

A copy of both the base config and the final config is stored in the scripts
logging directory.

Single fragment command line example:
-------------------------------------

	$ defconfig_merge.sh -c <path to the compiler>	\
		-o <output directory and file name>	\
		-e <path to single fragment file>	\
		-w <path to kernel's working directory>

"use-kernel-config=" - Is required to be defined.  This is the base defconfig
that the config fragments will be appended to.  This defconfig should be in the
Linux kernel path in arch/arm/configs.

	use-kernel-config= < defconfig base to start appending fragments >

"config-fragment=" - Is required to be defined.  There should be at least one
entry per config fragment.

	config-fragment= < path to the defconfig fragment file 1>

Multiple fragment command line example:
---------------------------------------

	export CROSS_COMPILE=~/linux_kernel/docs/toolchain/linaro-4.7/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-

	./ti_config_fragments/defconfig_merge.sh -o ~/Desktop/kernel/notes/kernel.txt
	-f ~/linux_kernel/lcpd_kernel/ti_config_fragments/defconfig_fragment -m
	-w ~/linux_kernel/lcpd_kernel/ -c $CROSS_COMPILE


Example:
use-kernel-config=omap2plus_defconfig
config-fragment=baseport.cfg
config-fragment=power.cfg
config-fragment=connectivity.cfg
config-fragment=ipc.cfg
config-fragment=audio_display.cfg
config-fragment=system_test.cfg


OPTIONS:
	Setup Options:
	-c  The path to the desired compiler
	-d  The defconfig to use as a base
	-e  Single defconfig fragment to append
	-j  How many build threads to use
	-o  Output log
	-l  uImage load address if different from 0x80008000 for no load address use ""

	Build Options:
	-n  Do not pre-build the defconfig just use the existing .config
	-m  MAKE the kernel, modules and dtb files based on the new config
	-w  Linux kernel path directory

	-f  Path to file with multiple defconfig options

2.0 Config Fragment File
------------------------

The config fragment file contains the CONFIG options that will need to be
turned on or off based on a base defconfig.

To turn on a config flag you merely create a file of any name and populate it
with CONFIG_BAR=y

Of course if CONFIG_BAR has a parent dependency, say CONFIG_FOO you will need
to turn that CONFIG option on as well so your file will need to look like this

CONFIG_FOO=y
CONFIG_BAR=y

You may want to disable a certain config option.  Normally in the config file
it is custumary to have an entry like this

# CONFIG_FOO is not set

Well the merge_config.sh within the kernel strips out all comments from the
passed in Config fragment file.  So in order to turn off a config option you
will need to explicitly state

CONFIG_FOO=n

Linux Kernel Script Location:
=============================

scripts/Kconfig/merge_config.sh

Linux Kernel Script Usage
=========================

To have the latest script usage information displayed please use the
command below in any linux kernel.

./scripts/Kconfig/merge_config.sh -h

Example:

./scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh -m -r -O <LOGGING_DIRECTORY> <APPENDED_CONFIGs>

In this example:
-m  =  only merge the fragments, do not execute the make command
-n  =  use allnoconfig instead of alldefconfig
-r  =  list redundant entries when merging fragments
-O  =  dir to put generated output files

TI Configuration files
======================

Below is a list of configuration files for each domain within TI.

These files contain configuration flags that are not currently set in the
omap2plus_defconfig but these features are available within the TI integration
kernel.

TI Baseport - baseport.cfg
TI Connectivity - connectivity.cfg
TI Audio and Display - audio_display.cfg
TI Power - power.cfg
TI System Test add-ons - system_test.cfg
