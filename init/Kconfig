	  lines however it might be much more when problems are reported,
	  e.g. backtraces.

	  The increased size means that a new buffer has to be allocated and
	  the original static one is unused. It makes sense only on systems
	  with more CPUs. Therefore this value is used only when the sum of
	  contributions is greater than the half of the default kernel ring
	  buffer as defined by LOG_BUF_SHIFT. The default values are set
	  so that more than 16 CPUs are needed to trigger the allocation.

	  Also this option is ignored when "log_buf_len" kernel parameter is
	  used as it forces an exact (power of two) size of the ring buffer.

	  The number of possible CPUs is used for this computation ignoring
	  hotplugging making the computation optimal for the worst case
	  scenario while allowing a simple algorithm to be used from bootup.

	  Examples shift values and their meaning:
		     17 => 128 KB for each CPU
		     16 =>  64 KB for each CPU
		     15 =>  32 KB for each CPU

	  The value defines the size as a power of 2.

	  Those messages are rare and limited. The largest one is when
	  a backtrace is printed. It usually fits into 4KB. Select
	  8KB if you want to be on the safe side.

	  Examples:

	  With this option, the user can specify the min and max CPU
	  utilization allowed for RUNNABLE tasks. The max utilization defines
	  the maximum frequency a task should use while the min utilization
	  defines the minimum frequency it should use.

	  will be SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE/UCLAMP_BUCKETS_COUNT. The higher the
	  number of clamp buckets the finer their granularity and the higher
	  the precision of clamping aggregation and tracking at run-time.

	  For example, with the minimum configuration value we will have 5
	  clamp buckets tracking 20% utilization each. A 25% boosted tasks will
	  be refcounted in the [20..39]% bucket and will set the bucket clamp
	  effective value to 25%.
	  If a second 30% boosted task should be co-scheduled on the same CPU,
	  that task will be refcounted in the same bucket of the first task and
	  it will boost the bucket clamp effective value to 30%.
	  The clamp effective value of a bucket is reset to its nominal value
	  (20% in the example above) when there are no more tasks refcounted in
	  that bucket.

	  An additional boost/capping margin can be added to some tasks. In the
	  example above the 25% task will be boosted to 30% until it exits the
	  CPU. If that should be considered not acceptable on certain systems,
	  it's always possible to reduce the margin by increasing the number of
	  clamp buckets to trade off used memory for run-time tracking
	  precision.

	  If in doubt, use the default value.

	  It should be noted that organisational operations (such as attaching

	  This option enables support for non-root users, groups and
	  capabilities.

	  If you say N here, all processes will run with UID 0, GID 0, and all
	  possible capabilities.  Saying N here also compiles out support for

	  architectures.

	  If unsure, leave the default option here.

config SYSFS_SYSCALL
	bool "Sysfs syscall support" if EXPERT
	default y
	help
	  sys_sysfs is an obsolete system call no longer supported in libc.
	  Note that disabling this option is more secure but might break
	  compatibility with some systems.

	  If unsure say Y here.

config FHANDLE
	bool "open by fhandle syscalls" if EXPERT
	select EXPORTFS
	default y
	help
	  If you say Y here, a user level program will be able to map
	  file names to handle and then later use the handle for
	  different file system operations. This is useful in implementing
	  userspace file servers, which now track files using handles instead
	  of names. The handle would remain the same even if file names
	  get renamed. Enables open_by_handle_at(2) and name_to_handle_at(2)
	  syscalls.

config POSIX_TIMERS
	bool "Posix Clocks & timers" if EXPERT
	default y
	help
	  This includes native support for POSIX timers to the kernel.
	  Some embedded systems have no use for them and therefore they
	  can be configured out to reduce the size of the kernel image.

	  When this option is disabled, the following syscalls won't be
	  available: timer_create, timer_gettime: timer_getoverrun,
	  timer_settime, timer_delete, clock_adjtime, getitimer,
	  setitimer, alarm. Furthermore, the clock_settime, clock_gettime,
	  clock_getres and clock_nanosleep syscalls will be limited to
	  CLOCK_REALTIME, CLOCK_MONOTONIC and CLOCK_BOOTTIME only.

	  If unsure say y.

config PRINTK
	default y
	bool "Enable support for printk" if EXPERT
	select IRQ_WORK
	help
	  This option enables normal printk support. Removing it
	  eliminates most of the message strings from the kernel image
	  and makes the kernel more or less silent. As this makes it
	  very difficult to diagnose system problems, saying N here is
	  strongly discouraged.

config HAVE_ATOMIC_CONSOLE
	bool
	default n

config BUG
	bool "BUG() support" if EXPERT
	default y
	help
	  Disabling this option eliminates support for BUG and WARN, reducing

	  numerous fatal conditions. You should only consider disabling this
	  option for embedded systems with no facilities for reporting errors.
	  Just say Y.

config ELF_CORE

	  If unsure, say Y.

config SHMEM
	bool "Use full shmem filesystem" if EXPERT
	default y
	depends on MMU
	help
	  The shmem is an internal filesystem used to manage shared memory.
	  It is backed by swap and manages resource limits. It is also exported
	  to userspace as tmpfs if TMPFS is enabled. Disabling this
	  option replaces shmem and tmpfs with the much simpler ramfs code,
	  which may be appropriate on small systems without swap.

config AIO
	bool "Enable AIO support" if EXPERT
	default y
	help
	  This option enables POSIX asynchronous I/O which may by used
	  by some high performance threaded applications. Disabling
	  this option saves about 7k.

config IO_URING
	bool "Enable IO uring support" if EXPERT
	select IO_WQ
	default y
	help
	  This option enables support for the io_uring interface, enabling

	  completion rings that are shared between the kernel and application.

config ADVISE_SYSCALLS
	bool "Enable madvise/fadvise syscalls" if EXPERT
	default y
	help
	  This option enables the madvise and fadvise syscalls, used by
	  applications to advise the kernel about their future memory or file
	  usage, improving performance. If building an embedded system where no
	  applications use these syscalls, you can disable this option to save
	  space.

config MEMBARRIER
	bool "Enable membarrier() system call" if EXPERT
	default y
	help
	  Enable the membarrier() system call that allows issuing memory
	  barriers across all running threads, which can be used to distribute
	  the cost of user-space memory barriers asymmetrically by transforming
	  pairs of memory barriers into pairs consisting of membarrier() and a
	  compiler barrier.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config KALLSYMS
	bool "Load all symbols for debugging/ksymoops" if EXPERT
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to let the kernel print out symbolic crash information and
	  symbolic stack backtraces. This increases the size of the kernel
	  somewhat, as all symbols have to be loaded into the kernel image.

config KALLSYMS_ALL
	bool "Include all symbols in kallsyms"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && KALLSYMS
	help
	  Normally kallsyms only contains the symbols of functions for nicer
	  OOPS messages and backtraces (i.e., symbols from the text and inittext
	  sections). This is sufficient for most cases. And only if you want to
	  enable kernel live patching, or other less common use cases (e.g.,
	  when a debugger is used) all symbols are required (i.e., names of
	  variables from the data sections, etc).

	  This option makes sure that all symbols are loaded into the kernel
	  image (i.e., symbols from all sections) in cost of increased kernel
	  size (depending on the kernel configuration, it may be 300KiB or
	  something like this).

	  Say N unless you really need all symbols, or kernel live patching.

config KALLSYMS_ABSOLUTE_PERCPU

config KALLSYMS_BASE_RELATIVE
	bool
	depends on KALLSYMS
	default !IA64
	help
	  Instead of emitting them as absolute values in the native word size,
	  emit the symbol references in the kallsyms table as 32-bit entries,
	  each containing a relative value in the range [base, base + U32_MAX]
	  or, when KALLSYMS_ABSOLUTE_PERCPU is in effect, each containing either
	  an absolute value in the range [0, S32_MAX] or a relative value in the
	  range [base, base + S32_MAX], where base is the lowest relative symbol
	  address encountered in the image.

	  On 64-bit builds, this reduces the size of the address table by 50%,
	  but more importantly, it results in entries whose values are build
	  time constants, and no relocation pass is required at runtime to fix
	  up the entries based on the runtime load address of the kernel.

	select SRCU
	help
	  Enable kernel support for various performance events provided
	  by software and hardware.

	  Software events are supported either built-in or via the
	  use of generic tracepoints.

	  Most modern CPUs support performance events via performance
	  counter registers. These registers count the number of certain
	  types of hw events: such as instructions executed, cachemisses
	  suffered, or branches mis-predicted - without slowing down the
	  kernel or applications. These registers can also trigger interrupts
	  when a threshold number of events have passed - and can thus be
	  used to profile the code that runs on that CPU.

	  The Linux Performance Event subsystem provides an abstraction of
	  these software and hardware event capabilities, available via a
	  system call and used by the "perf" utility in tools/perf/. It
	  provides per task and per CPU counters, and it provides event
	  capabilities on top of those.

	  Say Y if unsure.
