	  This option enables the mikroBUS driver. mikroBUS is an add-on
	  board socket standard that offers maximum expandability with
	  the smallest number of pins. The mikroBUS driver instantiates
	  devices on a mikroBUS port described by identifying data present
	  in an add-on board resident EEPROM, more details on the mikroBUS
	  driver support and discussion can be found in this eLinux wiki :
	  elinux.org/Mikrobus


	  Say Y here to enable support for this driver.

	  To compile this code as a module, chose M here: the module
	  will be called mikrobus.ko
