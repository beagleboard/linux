/* GOLDFISH DMA
 *
 * Goldfish DMA is an extension to the pipe device
 * and is designed to facilitate high-speed RAM->RAM
 * transfers from guest to host.
 *
 * Interface (guest side):
 *
 * The guest user calls goldfish_dma_alloc (ioctls)
 * and then mmap() on a goldfish pipe fd,
 * which means that it wants high-speed access to
 * host-visible memory.
 *
 * The guest can then write into the pointer
 * returned by mmap(), and these writes
 * become immediately visible on the host without BQL
 * or otherweise context switching.
 *
 * dma_alloc_coherent() is used to obtain contiguous
 * physical memory regions, and we allocate and interact
 * with this region on both guest and host through
 * the following ioctls:
 *
 * - LOCK: lock the region for data access.
 * - UNLOCK: unlock the region. This may also be done from the host
 *   through the WAKE_ON_UNLOCK_DMA procedure.
 * - CREATE_REGION: initialize size info for a dma region.
 * - GETOFF: send physical address to guest drivers.
 * - (UN)MAPHOST: uses goldfish_pipe_cmd to tell the host to
 * (un)map to the guest physical address associated
 * with the current dma context. This makes the physically
 * contiguous memory (in)visible to the host.
 *
 * Guest userspace obtains a pointer to the DMA memory
 * through mmap(), which also lazily allocates the memory
 * with dma_alloc_coherent. (On last pipe close(), the region is freed).
 * The mmaped() region can handle very high bandwidth
 * transfers, and pipe operations can be used at the same
 * time to handle synchronization and command communication.
