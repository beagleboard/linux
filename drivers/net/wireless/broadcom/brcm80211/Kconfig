	  This module adds support for PCIe wireless adapters based on Broadcom
	  IEEE802.11n SoftMAC chipsets. It also has WLAN led support, which will
	  be available if you select BCMA_DRIVER_GPIO. If you choose to build a
	  module, the driver will be called brcmsmac.ko.

	help
	  If you say Y here, the Broadcom wireless drivers will register
	  with ftrace to dump event information into the trace ringbuffer.
	  Tracing can be enabled at runtime to aid in debugging wireless
	  issues. This option adds a small amount of overhead when tracing
	  is disabled. If unsure, say Y to allow developers to better help
	  you when wireless problems occur.
