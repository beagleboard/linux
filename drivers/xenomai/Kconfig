config XENO_OPT_RTDM_COMPAT_DEVNODE
	bool "Enable legacy pathnames for named RTDM devices"
	default y
	help
	This compatibility option allows applications to open named
	RTDM devices using the legacy naming scheme, i.e.

	fd = open("devname", ...);
	   or
	fd = open("/dev/devname", ...);

	When such a request is received by RTDM, a warning message is
	issued to the kernel log whenever XENO_OPT_DEBUG_LEGACY is
	also enabled in the kernel configuration.

	Applications should open named devices via their actual device
	nodes instead, i.e.

	fd = open("/dev/rtdm/devname", ...);
