	depends on NET
	help
	  Say Y here to export rpmsg endpoints as device files, usually found
	  in /dev. They make it possible for user-space programs to send and
	  receive rpmsg packets.

	depends on MAILBOX
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the GLINK RPM communication driver,
	  which serves as a channel for communication with the RPM in GLINK
	  enabled systems.

	tristate "Qualcomm SMEM Glink driver"
	select RPMSG_QCOM_GLINK_NATIVE
	depends on MAILBOX
	depends on QCOM_SMEM
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the GLINK SMEM communication driver,
	  which provides support for using the GLINK communication protocol
	  over SMEM.

config RPMSG_QCOM_SMD
	tristate "Qualcomm Shared Memory Driver (SMD)"
	depends on QCOM_SMEM
	select RPMSG
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the Qualcomm Shared Memory Driver
	  providing communication channels to remote processors in Qualcomm
	  platforms.

	select DMA_SHARED_BUFFER
	---help---
	  An rpmsg driver that exposes the Remote Procedure Call API to
	  user space, in order to allow applications to distribute
	  remote calls to more power-efficient remote processors. This is
	  currently available only on OMAP4+ systems.

	  If unsure, say N.

config RPMSG_PRU
	tristate "PRU RPMsg Communication driver"
	default n
	depends on RPMSG_VIRTIO
	depends on REMOTEPROC
	depends on PRUSS_REMOTEPROC
	---help---
	  An rpmsg driver that exposes interfaces to user space, to allow
	  applications to communicate with the PRU processors on available
	  TI SoCs. This is restricted to SoCs that have the PRUSS remoteproc
	  support.

	  If unsure, say N.

config CONFIG_RPMSG_GPIOHIP_INTERFACE
	tristate "A rpmsg driver  with gpiochip interface"
	default m
	depends on RPMSG_VIRTIO
	depends on REMOTEPROC
	help
	  This driver provides provides gpiochip inteface which can be accessed
	  in userspace using libgpiod. You would see a char dev interface in
          "/dev" using this driver. Follow the README from the following
          repo for more info.
