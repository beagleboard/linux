/*
 * Each physical page in the system has a struct page associated with
 * it to keep track of whatever it is we are using the page for at the
 * moment. Note that we have no way to track which tasks are using
 * a page, though if it is a pagecache page, rmap structures can tell us
 * who is mapping it.
 *
 * If you allocate the page using alloc_pages(), you can use some of the
 * space in struct page for your own purposes.  The five words in the main
 * union are available, except for bit 0 of the first word which must be
 * kept clear.  Many users use this word to store a pointer to an object
 * which is guaranteed to be aligned.  If you use the same storage as
 * page->mapping, you must restore it to NULL before freeing the page.
 *
 * If your page will not be mapped to userspace, you can also use the four
 * bytes in the mapcount union, but you must call page_mapcount_reset()
 * before freeing it.
 *
 * If you want to use the refcount field, it must be used in such a way
 * that other CPUs temporarily incrementing and then decrementing the
 * refcount does not cause problems.  On receiving the page from
 * alloc_pages(), the refcount will be positive.
 *
 * If you allocate pages of order > 0, you can use some of the fields
 * in each subpage, but you may need to restore some of their values
 * afterwards.
 *
 * SLUB uses cmpxchg_double() to atomically update its freelist and counters.
 * That requires that freelist & counters in struct slab be adjacent and
 * double-word aligned. Because struct slab currently just reinterprets the
 * bits of struct page, we align all struct pages to double-word boundaries,
 * and ensure that 'freelist' is aligned within struct slab.

 * @FAULT_FLAG_ALLOW_RETRY: Allow to retry the fault if blocked.
 * @FAULT_FLAG_RETRY_NOWAIT: Don't drop mmap_lock and wait when retrying.
 * @FAULT_FLAG_KILLABLE: The fault task is in SIGKILL killable region.
 * @FAULT_FLAG_TRIED: The fault has been tried once.
 * @FAULT_FLAG_USER: The fault originated in userspace.
 * @FAULT_FLAG_REMOTE: The fault is not for current task/mm.
 * @FAULT_FLAG_INSTRUCTION: The fault was during an instruction fetch.
 * @FAULT_FLAG_INTERRUPTIBLE: The fault can be interrupted by non-fatal signals.
 * @FAULT_FLAG_UNSHARE: The fault is an unsharing request to unshare (and mark
 *                      exclusive) a possibly shared anonymous page that is
 *                      mapped R/O.
 * @FAULT_FLAG_ORIG_PTE_VALID: whether the fault has vmf->orig_pte cached.
 *                        We should only access orig_pte if this flag set.
 *
 * About @FAULT_FLAG_ALLOW_RETRY and @FAULT_FLAG_TRIED: we can specify
 * whether we would allow page faults to retry by specifying these two
 * fault flags correctly.  Currently there can be three legal combinations:
 *
 * (a) ALLOW_RETRY and !TRIED:  this means the page fault allows retry, and
 *                              this is the first try
 *
 * (b) ALLOW_RETRY and TRIED:   this means the page fault allows retry, and
 *                              we've already tried at least once
 *
 * (c) !ALLOW_RETRY and !TRIED: this means the page fault does not allow retry
 *
 * The unlisted combination (!ALLOW_RETRY && TRIED) is illegal and should never
 * be used.  Note that page faults can be allowed to retry for multiple times,
 * in which case we'll have an initial fault with flags (a) then later on
 * continuous faults with flags (b).  We should always try to detect pending
 * signals before a retry to make sure the continuous page faults can still be
 * interrupted if necessary.
 *
 * The combination FAULT_FLAG_WRITE|FAULT_FLAG_UNSHARE is illegal.
 * FAULT_FLAG_UNSHARE is ignored and treated like an ordinary read fault when
 * no existing R/O-mapped anonymous page is encountered.
