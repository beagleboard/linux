	  symmetric key for a block encryption pass applied to the input
	  IV, making low entropy IV sources more suitable for block
	  encryption.

	  This driver implements a crypto API template that can be
	  instantiated either as an skcipher or as an AEAD (depending on the
	  type of the first template argument), and which defers encryption
	  and decryption requests to the encapsulated cipher after applying
	  ESSIV to the input IV. Note that in the AEAD case, it is assumed
	  that the keys are presented in the same format used by the authenc
	  template, and that the IV appears at the end of the authenticated
	  associated data (AAD) region (which is how dm-crypt uses it.)

	  Note that the use of ESSIV is not recommended for new deployments,
	  and so this only needs to be enabled when interoperability with
	  existing encrypted volumes of filesystems is required, or when
	  building for a particular system that requires it (e.g., when
	  the SoC in question has accelerated CBC but not XTS, making CBC
	  combined with ESSIV the only feasible mode for h/w accelerated
	  block encryption)
