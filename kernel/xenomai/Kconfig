config XENO_OPT_SCHED_CLASSES
	bool "Extra scheduling classes"
	default n
	help
	The Cobalt kernel implements a set of scheduling classes.
	Each scheduling class defines its own set of rules for
	determining when and how to select a new thread to run.

	Cobalt has a built-in real-time class, which supports both
	preemptive fixed-priority FIFO, and round-robin scheduling.

	Enabling CONFIG_XENO_OPT_SCHED_CLASSES allows you to select
	additional scheduling classes to enable in the Cobalt kernel.

	If in doubt, say N.

config XENO_OPT_SCHED_WEAK
	bool "Weak scheduling class"
	default n
	depends on XENO_OPT_SCHED_CLASSES
	help
	This option creates a Cobalt scheduling class for mapping
	members of the regular POSIX SCHED_FIFO/RR policies to a low
	priority class of the Cobalt kernel, providing no real-time
	guarantee. Therefore, up to a hundred non real-time priority
	levels are available from the SCHED_WEAK policy.

	When CONFIG_XENO_OPT_SCHED_WEAK is disabled, Cobalt still
	supports a single non real-time priority level (i.e. zero
	priority), assigned to members of the SCHED_OTHER class.

	SCHED_WEAK/SCHED_OTHER threads can access Cobalt resources,
	wait on Cobalt synchronization objects, but cannot compete for
	the CPU with members of the real-time Cobalt classes.

	Since Cobalt assumes no real-time requirement for
	SCHED_WEAK/SCHED_OTHER threads, they are automatically moved
	back to secondary mode upon return from any Cobalt syscall if
	necessary, unless they hold a Cobalt mutex, which would defer
	the transition until such mutex is released.

	If in doubt, say N.

config XENO_OPT_SCHED_TP
	bool "Temporal partitioning"
	default n
	depends on XENO_OPT_SCHED_CLASSES
	help
	This option enables support for temporal partitioning.

	If in doubt, say N.

config XENO_OPT_SCHED_TP_NRPART
	int "Number of partitions"
	default 4
	range 1 1024
	depends on XENO_OPT_SCHED_TP
	help
	Define here the maximum number of temporal partitions the TP
	scheduler may have to handle.

config XENO_OPT_SCHED_SPORADIC
	bool "Sporadic scheduling"
	default n
	depends on XENO_OPT_SCHED_CLASSES
	help
	This option enables support for the sporadic scheduling policy
	in the Cobalt kernel (SCHED_SPORADIC), also known as POSIX
	sporadic server.

	It can be used to enforce a capped limit on the execution time
	of a thread within a given period of time.

	If in doubt, say N.

config XENO_OPT_SCHED_SPORADIC_MAXREPL
	int "Maximum number of pending replenishments"
	default 8
	range 4 16
	depends on XENO_OPT_SCHED_SPORADIC
	help
	For performance reason, the budget replenishment information
	is statically stored on a per-thread basis. This parameter
	defines the maximum number of replenishment requests that can
	be pending concurrently for any given thread that undergoes
	sporadic scheduling (system minimum is 4).

config XENO_OPT_SCHED_QUOTA
	bool "Thread groups with runtime quota"
	default n
	depends on XENO_OPT_SCHED_CLASSES
	help
	This option enables the SCHED_QUOTA scheduling policy in the
	Cobalt kernel.

	This policy enforces a limitation on the CPU consumption of
	threads over a globally defined period, known as the quota
	interval. This is done by pooling threads with common
	requirements in groups, and giving each group a share of the
	global period (see CONFIG_XENO_OPT_SCHED_QUOTA_PERIOD).

	When threads have entirely consumed the quota allotted to the
	group they belong to, the latter is suspended as a whole,
	until the next quota interval starts. At this point, a new
	runtime budget is given to each group, in accordance with its
	share.

	If in doubt, say N.

config XENO_OPT_SCHED_QUOTA_PERIOD
	int "Quota interval (us)"
	default 10000
	range 100 1000000000
	depends on XENO_OPT_SCHED_QUOTA
	help
	The global period thread groups can get a share of.

	int "Number of thread groups"
	default 32
	range 1 1024
	depends on XENO_OPT_SCHED_QUOTA
	help
	The overall number of thread groups which may be defined
	across all CPUs.

config XENO_OPT_STATS
	bool "Runtime statistics"
	depends on XENO_OPT_VFILE
	default y
	help
	This option causes the Cobalt kernel to collect various
	per-thread runtime statistics, which are accessible through
	the /proc/xenomai/sched/stat interface.

config XENO_OPT_STATS_IRQS
	bool "Account IRQ handlers separatly"
	depends on XENO_OPT_STATS
	default y
	help
	When enabled, the runtime of interrupt handlers is accounted
	separately from the threads they interrupt. Also, the
	occurrence of shared interrupts is accounted on a per-handler
	basis.

config XENO_OPT_SHIRQ
	bool "Shared interrupts"
	help
	Enables support for both level- and edge-triggered shared
	interrupts, so that multiple real-time interrupt handlers
	are allowed to control dedicated hardware devices which are
	configured to share the same interrupt line.

config XENO_OPT_RR_QUANTUM
	int "Round-robin quantum (us)"
	default 1000
	help
	This parameter defines the duration of the default round-robin
	time quantum expressed as a count of micro-seconds. This value
	may be overriden internally by Cobalt services which do
	provide a round-robin interval.

config XENO_OPT_AUTOTUNE
        tristate "Auto-tuning"
        default y
	select XENO_DRIVERS_AUTOTUNE
        help
	Enable auto-tuning capabilities. Auto-tuning is used for
	adjusting the core timing services to the intrinsic latency of
	the platform.

config XENO_OPT_SCALABLE_SCHED
	bool "O(1) scheduler"
	help
	This option causes a multi-level priority queue to be used in
	the real-time scheduler, so that it operates in constant-time
	regardless of the number of _concurrently runnable_ threads
	(which might be much lower than the total number of active
	threads).

	Its use is recommended for large multi-threaded systems
	involving more than 10 of such threads; otherwise, the default
	linear method usually performs better with lower memory
	footprints.

choice
	prompt "Timer indexing method"
	default XENO_OPT_TIMER_LIST if !X86_64
	default XENO_OPT_TIMER_RBTREE if X86_64
	help
	This option allows to select the underlying data structure
	which is going to be used for ordering the outstanding
	software timers managed by the Cobalt kernel.

config XENO_OPT_TIMER_LIST
	bool "Linear"
	help
	Use a linked list. Albeit O(N), this simple data structure is
	particularly efficient when only a few timers (< 10) may be
	concurrently outstanding at any point in time.

config XENO_OPT_TIMER_RBTREE
	bool "Tree"
	help
	Use a red-black tree. This data structure is efficient when a
	high number of software timers may be concurrently
	outstanding at any point in time.

	depends on XENO_OPT_PIPE
	default 32
	help
	Message pipes are bi-directional FIFO communication channels
	allowing data exchange between Cobalt threads and regular
	POSIX threads. Pipes natively preserve message boundaries, but
	can also be used in byte streaming mode from kernel to
	user-space.

	This option sets the maximum number of pipe devices supported
	in the system. Pipe devices are named /dev/rtpN where N is a
	device minor number ranging from 0 to XENO_OPT_PIPE_NRDEV - 1.

config XENO_OPT_REGISTRY_NRSLOTS
	int "Number of registry slots"
	default 512

	Each named resource occupies a registry slot. This option sets
	the maximum number of resources the registry can handle.

config XENO_OPT_SYS_HEAPSZ

config XENO_OPT_PRIVATE_HEAPSZ
	int "Size of private heap (Kb)"
	default 256
	help
	The Cobalt kernel implements fast IPC mechanisms within the
	scope of a process which require a private kernel memory heap
	to be mapped in the address space of each Xenomai application
	process. This option can be used to set the size of this
	per-process heap.

	64k is considered a large enough size for common use cases.

config XENO_OPT_SHARED_HEAPSZ
	int "Size of shared heap (Kb)"
	default 256
	help
	The Cobalt kernel implements fast IPC mechanisms between
	processes which require a shared kernel memory heap to be
	mapped in the address space of all Xenomai application
	processes. This option can be used to set the size of this
	system-wide heap.

	64k is considered a large enough size for common use cases.

config XENO_OPT_NRTIMERS

config XENO_OPT_TIMING_SCHEDLAT
	int "User scheduling latency (ns)"
	default 0
	help
	The user scheduling latency is the time between the
	termination of an interrupt handler and the execution of the
	first instruction of the real-time application thread this
	handler resumes. A default value of 0 (recommended) will cause
	a pre-calibrated value to be used.

	If the auto-tuner is enabled, this value will be used as the
	factory default when running "autotune --reset".

config XENO_OPT_TIMING_KSCHEDLAT
	int "Intra-kernel scheduling latency (ns)"
	default 0
	help
	The intra-kernel scheduling latency is the time between the
	termination of an interrupt handler and the execution of the
	first instruction of the RTDM kernel thread this handler
	resumes. A default value of 0 (recommended) will cause a
	pre-calibrated value to be used.

	Intra-kernel latency is usually significantly lower than user
	scheduling latency on MMU-enabled platforms, due to CPU cache
	latency.

	If the auto-tuner is enabled, this value will be used as the
	factory default when running "autotune --reset".

config XENO_OPT_TIMING_IRQLAT
	int "Interrupt latency (ns)"
	default 0
	help
	The interrupt latency is the time between the occurrence of an
	IRQ and the first instruction of the interrupt handler which
	will service it. A default value of 0 (recommended) will cause
	a pre-calibrated value to be used.

	If the auto-tuner is enabled, this value will be used as the
	factory default when running "autotune --reset".

config XENO_OPT_DEBUG_USER
	bool "User consistency checks"
	help
	  This option enables a set of consistency checks for
	  detecting wrong runtime behavior in user applications.

	  With some of the debug categories, threads can ask for
	  notification when a problem is detected, by turning on the
	  PTHREAD_WARNSW mode bit with pthread_setmode_np().  Cobalt
	  sends the Linux-originated SIGDEBUG signal for notifying
	  threads, along with a reason code passed into the associated
	  siginfo data (see pthread_setmode_np()).
	
	  Some of these runtime checks may induce overhead, enable
