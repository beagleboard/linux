 * lock->owner state tracking:

 * is used to keep track of the "lock has waiters" state.
 *
 * owner	bit0
 * NULL		0	lock is free (fast acquire possible)
 * NULL		1	lock is free and has waiters and the top waiter
 *				is going to take the lock*
 * taskpointer	0	lock is held (fast release possible)
 * taskpointer	1	lock is held and has waiters**
 *
 * The fast atomic compare exchange based acquire and release is only
 * possible when bit 0 of lock->owner is 0.
 *
 * (*) It also can be a transitional state when grabbing the lock
 * with ->wait_lock is held. To prevent any fast path cmpxchg to the lock,
 * we need to set the bit0 before looking at the lock, and the owner may be
 * NULL in this small time, hence this can be a transitional state.
 *
 * (**) There is a small time when bit 0 is set but there are no
 * waiters. This can happen when grabbing the lock in the slow path.
 * To prevent a cmpxchg of the owner releasing the lock, we need to
 * set this bit before looking at the lock.
