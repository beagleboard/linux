 * RT-specific reader/writer semaphores and reader/writer locks
 *
 * down_write/write_lock()
 *  1) Lock rtmutex
 *  2) Remove the reader BIAS to force readers into the slow path
 *  3) Wait until all readers have left the critical section
 *  4) Mark it write locked
 *
 * up_write/write_unlock()
 *  1) Remove the write locked marker
 *  2) Set the reader BIAS, so readers can use the fast path again
 *  3) Unlock rtmutex, to release blocked readers
 *
 * down_read/read_lock()
 *  1) Try fast path acquisition (reader BIAS is set)
 *  2) Take tmutex::wait_lock, which protects the writelocked flag
 *  3) If !writelocked, acquire it for read
 *  4) If writelocked, block on tmutex
 *  5) unlock rtmutex, goto 1)
 *
 * up_read/read_unlock()
 *  1) Try fast path release (reader count != 1)
 *  2) Wake the writer waiting in down_write()/write_lock() #3
 *
 * down_read/read_lock()#3 has the consequence, that rw semaphores and rw
 * locks on RT are not writer fair, but writers, which should be avoided in
 * RT tasks (think mmap_sem), are subject to the rtmutex priority/DL
 * inheritance mechanism.
 *
 * It's possible to make the rw primitives writer fair by keeping a list of
 * active readers. A blocked writer would force all newly incoming readers
 * to block on the rtmutex, but the rtmutex would have to be proxy locked
 * for one reader after the other. We can't use multi-reader inheritance
 * because there is no way to support that with SCHED_DEADLINE.
 * Implementing the one by one reader boosting/handover mechanism is a
 * major surgery for a very dubious value.
 *
 * The risk of writer starvation is there, but the pathological use cases
 * which trigger it are not necessarily the typical RT workloads.
 *
 * Fast-path orderings:
 * The lock/unlock of readers can run in fast paths: lock and unlock are only
 * atomic ops, and there is no inner lock to provide ACQUIRE and RELEASE
 * semantics of rwbase_rt. Atomic ops should thus provide _acquire()
 * and _release() (or stronger).
 *
 * Common code shared between RT rw_semaphore and rwlock
