Contact:	Pantelis Antoniou <pantelis.antoniou@konsulko.com>
Description:
		The master enable switch, by default is 1, and when

		The discussion about this switch takes place in:
		http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.devicetree/101871

		Kees Cook:
		"Coming from the perspective of drawing a bright line between
		kernel and the root user (which tends to start with disabling
		kernel module loading), I would say that there at least needs
		to be a high-level one-way "off" switch for the interface so
		that systems that have this interface can choose to turn it off
		during initial boot, etc."
