Device Tree Overlay Notes
-------------------------

This document describes the implementation of the in-kernel
device tree overlay functionality residing in drivers/of/overlay.c and is a
companion document to Documentation/devicetree/dt-object-internal.txt[1] &
Documentation/devicetree/dynamic-resolution-notes.txt[2]

How overlays work
-----------------

A Device Tree's overlay purpose is to modify the kernel's live tree, and
have the modification affecting the state of the the kernel in a way that
is reflecting the changes.
Since the kernel mainly deals with devices, any new device node that result
in an active device should have it created while if the device node is either
disabled or removed all together, the affected device should be deregistered.

Lets take an example where we have a foo board with the following base tree
which is taken from [1].

---- foo.dts -----------------------------------------------------------------
	/* FOO platform */
	/ {
		compatible = "corp,foo";

		/* shared resources */
		res: res {
		};

		/* On chip peripherals */
		ocp: ocp {
			/* peripherals that are always instantiated */
			peripheral1 { ... };
		}
	};
---- foo.dts -----------------------------------------------------------------

The overlay bar.dts, when loaded (and resolved as described in [2]) should

---- bar.dts -----------------------------------------------------------------
/plugin/;	/* allow undefined label references and record them */
/ {
	....	/* various properties for loader use; i.e. part id etc. */
	fragment@0 {
		target = <&ocp>;
		__overlay__ {
			/* bar peripheral */
			bar {
				compatible = "corp,bar";
				... /* various properties and child nodes */
			}
		};
	};
};
---- bar.dts -----------------------------------------------------------------

result in foo+bar.dts

---- foo+bar.dts -------------------------------------------------------------
	/* FOO platform + bar peripheral */
	/ {
		compatible = "corp,foo";

		/* shared resources */
		res: res {
		};

		/* On chip peripherals */
		ocp: ocp {
			/* peripherals that are always instantiated */
			peripheral1 { ... };

			/* bar peripheral */
			bar {
				compatible = "corp,bar";
				... /* various properties and child nodes */
			}
		}
	};
---- foo+bar.dts -------------------------------------------------------------

As a result of the the overlay, a new device node (bar) has been created
so a bar platform device will be registered and if a matching device driver
is loaded the device will be created as expected.

Overlay in-kernel API
---------------------

The steps typically required to get an overlay to work are as follows:

1. Use of_build_overlay_info() to create an array of initialized and
ready to use of_overlay_info structures.
2. Call of_overlay() to apply the overlays declared in the array.
3. If the overlay needs to be removed, call of_overlay_revert().
4. Finally release the memory taken by the overlay info array by
of_free_overlay_info().

/**
 * of_build_overlay_info	- Build an overlay info array
 * @tree:	Device node containing all the overlays
 * @cntp:	Pointer to where the overlay info count will be help
 * @ovinfop:	Pointer to the pointer of an overlay info structure.
 *
 * Helper function that given a tree containing overlay information,
 * allocates and builds an overlay info array containing it, ready
 * for use using of_overlay.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success with the @cntp @ovinfop pointers valid,
 * while on error a negative error value is returned.
 */
int of_build_overlay_info(struct device_node *tree,
		int *cntp, struct of_overlay_info **ovinfop);

/**
 * of_free_overlay_info	- Free an overlay info array
 * @count:	Number of of_overlay_info's
 * @ovinfo_tab:	Array of overlay_info's to free
 *
 * Releases the memory of a previously allocate ovinfo array
 * by of_build_overlay_info.
 * Returns 0, or an error if the arguments are bogus.
 */
int of_free_overlay_info(int count, struct of_overlay_info *ovinfo_tab);

/**
 * of_overlay	- Apply @count overlays pointed at by @ovinfo_tab
 * @count:	Number of of_overlay_info's
 * @ovinfo_tab:	Array of overlay_info's to apply
 *
 * Applies the overlays given, while handling all error conditions
 * appropriately. Either the operation succeeds, or if it fails the
 * live tree is reverted to the state before the attempt.
 * Returns 0, or an error if the overlay attempt failed.
 */
int of_overlay(int count, struct of_overlay_info *ovinfo_tab);

/**
 * of_overlay_revert	- Revert a previously applied overlay
 * @count:	Number of of_overlay_info's
 * @ovinfo_tab:	Array of overlay_info's to apply
 *
 * Revert a previous overlay. The state of the live tree
 * is reverted to the one before the overlay.
 * Returns 0, or an error if the overlay table is not given.
 */
int of_overlay_revert(int count, struct of_overlay_info *ovinfo_tab);

Overlay DTS Format
------------------

The DTS of an overlay should have the following format:

{
	/* ignored properties by the overlay */

	fragment@0 {	/* first child node */
		target=<phandle>;	/* target of the overlay */
		__overlay__ {
			property-a;	/* add property-a to the target */
			-property-b;	/* remove property-b from target */
			node-a {	/* add to an existing, or create a node-a */
				...
			};
			-node-b {	/* remove an existing node-b */
				...
			};
		};
	}
	fragment@1 {	/* second child node */
		...
	};
	/* more fragments follow */
}

It should be noted that the DT overlay format described is the one expected
by the of_build_overlay_info() function, which is a helper function. There
is nothing stopping someone coming up with his own DTS format and that will
end up filling in the fields of the of_overlay_info array.
