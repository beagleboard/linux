PRU Core on TI SoCs
===================

Each PRUSS has dual PRU cores, each represented by a PRU node. Each PRU core
has a dedicated Instruction RAM, Control and Debug register sets, and use
the Data RAMs present within the PRUSS for code execution.

Each PRU core node should be defined as a child node of the corresponding PRUSS
node. Each node can optionally be rendered inactive by using the standard DT
string property, "status".

Please see the overall PRUSS bindings document for additional details
including a complete example,
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/ti/ti,pruss.txt

Required Properties:
--------------------
- compatible     : should be
                       "ti,am3356-pru" for AM335x family of SoCs
                       "ti,am4376-pru" for AM437x family of SoCs
                       "ti,am5728-pru" for AM57xx family of SoCs
                       "ti,k2g-pru" for 66AK2G family of SoCs
- reg            : base address and size for each of the 3 sub-module address
                   spaces as mentioned in reg-names, and in the same order as
                   the reg-names
- reg-names      : should contain each of the following 3 names, the binding is
                   agnostic of the order of these reg-names, preferable to have
                   the "iram" entry as the first one
                       "iram" for Instruction RAM,
                       "control" for the CTRL sub-module registers,
                       "debug" for the Debug sub-module registers,
- firmware-name  : should contain the name of the default firmware image file
                   located on the firmware search path

Optional Properties:
--------------------
The virtio based communication between the MPU and a PRU core _requires_
either the 'mboxes' property, or the set of 'interrupt-parent', 'interrupts'
and 'interrupt-names' properties to be defined. The latter option is the
preferred choice. The 'mboxes' property is not applicable for 66AK2G and
DA850/OMAP-L138 SoCs.

- mboxes           : OMAP Mailbox specifier denoting the sub-mailbox, if using
                     a mailbox for IPC signalling between host and a PRU core.
                     The specifier format is as per the bindings,
                         Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/omap-mailbox.txt
                     This property should match with the sub-mailbox node used
                     in the corresponding firmware image.
- interrupt-parent : phandle to the PRUSS INTC node. Should be defined if
                     interrupts property is to be used.
- interrupts       : array of interrupt specifiers if using PRU system events
                     for IPC signalling between host and a PRU core. This
                     property should match with the PRU system event used in
                     the corresponding firmware image.
- interrupt-names  : should use one of the following names for each interrupt,
                     the name should match the corresponding PRU system event
                     number,
                         "vring" - for PRU to HOST virtqueue signalling
                         "kick"  - for HOST to PRU virtqueue signalling
