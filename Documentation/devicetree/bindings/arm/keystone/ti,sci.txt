Texas Instruments System Control Interface (TI-SCI) Message Protocol
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Texas Instrument's processors including those belonging to Keystone generation
of processors have separate hardware entity which is now responsible for the
management of the System on Chip (SoC) system. These include various system
level functions as well.

TI-SCI controller Device Node:
=============================

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible: should be "ti,k2g-sci"
- mbox-names:
	"rx" - Mailbox corresponding to receive path
	"tx" - Mailbox corresponding to transmit path

- mboxes: Mailboxes corresponding to the mbox-names. Each value of the mboxes
	  property should contain a phandle to the mailbox controller device
	  node and an args specifier that will be the phandle to the intended
	  sub-mailbox child node to be used for communication.

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/mailbox.txt for more details
about the generic mailbox controller and client driver bindings. Also see
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/ti,message-manager.txt for typical
controller that is used to communicate with this System controllers.

Optional Properties:
--------------------
- reg-names:
	debug_messages - Map the Debug message region
- reg:  register space corresponding to the debug_messages
- ti,system-reboot-controller: If system reboot can be triggered by SoC reboot

Example (K2G):
--------
	pmmc: pmmc {
		compatible = "ti,k2g-sci";
		mbox-names = "rx", "tx";
		mboxes= <&msgmgr &msgmgr_proxy_pmmc_rx>,
			<&msgmgr &msgmgr_proxy_pmmc_tx>;
		reg-names = "debug_messages";
		reg = <0x02921800 0x800>;
	};


TI-SCI Client Device Node:
========================

Client nodes refer to the required TI-SCI device using the "ti,sci" property.

Example (K2G):
-------------
	my_dev_node: dev_node {
		...
		ti,sci = <&pmmc>;
		...
	}
