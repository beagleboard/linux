title: DMA-BUF contiguous buffer physical address user-space exporter

maintainer: Gowtham Tammana <g-tammana@ti.com>

description: |
  Driver allowing user-space attaching of DMA-BUFs returning CPU
  physical addresses. The reasoning for making this act like a regular
  device described by DT is so the virtual device that binds the buffer
  can be made to act as if it is out on a bus or behind an IOMMU, for
  example.
