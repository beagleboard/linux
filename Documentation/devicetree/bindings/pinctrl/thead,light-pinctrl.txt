* Thead Light PAD mux controller

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

Thead light pin configuration node is a node of a group of pins which can be
used for a specific device or function. This node represents both mux_mode and
config of the pins in that group. The 'mux_mode' selects the function mode,
and the 'config' configures various pad settings such as pull-up, open drain,
drive strength, etc.

Required properties for padmux controller:
- compatible: "thead,light-<soc>-pinctrl"
- reg: the padmux config/mux_mode registers base address.
- thead,pins: each entry consists of 3 integers and represents:
	      <pin_id mux_mode config>
  pin_id macro can be found in include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/light-pinctrl.h.
  config is the pad setting value like pull-up on this pin.


Examples:
#include <dt-bindings/pinctrl/light-pinctrl.h>

/* Pin Controller Node */
padmux0: pinctrl@ffef01c000 {
	compatible = "thead,light-mpw-pinctrl";
	reg = <0xff 0xef01c000 0x0 0x4000>;

	light-mpw-evb {
		/* Pin Configuration Node:
		 * Format: <pin_id  mux_mode  config>
		 */
		pinctrl_uart0: uart0grp {
			thead,pins = <
				UART0_RXD	0x0	0x72
				UART0_TXD	0x0	0x72
			>;
		};
	};
};
