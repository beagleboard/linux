Texas Instruments PRUSS Ethernet MAC
====================================

Required properties:
- compatible       : Should be one of the following,
                        "ti,am3359-prueth" for AM335x SoCs
                        "ti,am4376-prueth" for AM437x SoCs
                        "ti,am57-prueth" for AM57xx SoCs
                        "ti,k2g-prueth" for 66AK2G SoCs

- prus             : list of pHandles to the PRU nodes
- sram	           : pHandle to OCMC SRAM node
- interrupt-parent : pHandle to the PRUSS INTC node
- mii-rt	   : pHandle to MII_RT module's syscon regmap
- iep		   : pHandle to IEP module's syscon regmap

Must contain children, one for each of the MAC ports.
Children must be named ethernet-mii0 and ethernet-mii1.
Either one or both children can be present. If only one
child is present driver operates in single EMAC mode.

For single mode operation with the 2nd PRU, you still need
to provide both PRUs. See 2nd example.

Required properties for children:
- phy-handle       : See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- phy-mode         : See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- interrupt-names  : should be "rx"
- interrupts       : should contain an array of PRUSS system event
                     numbers used as the interrupt sources for Rx.

Optional properties for children:
- local-mac-address	: mac address for the port.
- ti,no-half-duplex	: disable half-duplex.
- interrupt-names	: add "tx" when using Dual EMAC firmware to
			  get a better egress performance at MTU size.
			  Note that this reduces the performance
			  for small size frames. So use it only if
			  specific application uses mostly MTU or near
			  MTU size frames.
- interrupts		: Add interrupt sources for Tx if
			  interrupt-names "tx" used.

Example (am572x-idk board, dual-emac):
======================================
	pruss2_eth {
		compatible = "ti,am57-prueth";
		prus = <&pru2_0>, <&pru2_1>;
		sram = <&ocmcram1>;
		interrupt-parent = <&pruss2_intc>;
		mii-rt = <&pruss2_mii_rt>;
		iep = <&pruss2_iep>;

		pruss2_emac0: ethernet-mii0 {
			phy-handle = <&pruss2_eth0_phy>;
			phy-mode = "mii";
			interrupts = <20>, <22>;
			interrupt-names = "rx", "tx";
			/* Filled in by bootloader */
			local-mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];
		};

		pruss2_emac1: ethernet-mii1 {
			phy-handle = <&pruss2_eth1_phy>;
			phy-mode = "mii";
			interrupts = <21>, <23>;
			interrupt-names = "rx", "tx";
			/* Filled in by bootloader */
			local-mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];
		};
	};

Example (am572x-idk board, single-emac):
=======================================
	pruss2_eth {
		compatible = "ti,am57-prueth";
		prus = <&pru2_0>, <&pru2_1>;
		sram = <&ocmcram1>;
		interrupt-parent = <&pruss2_intc>;
		mii-rt = <&pruss2_mii_rt>;
		iep = <&pruss2_iep>;

		pruss2_emac1: ethernet-mii1 {
			phy-handle = <&pruss2_eth1_phy>;
			phy-mode = "mii";
			interrupts = <21>, <23>;
			interrupt-names = "rx", "tx";
			/* Filled in by bootloader */
			local-mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];
		};
	};
