	  For debug cards on TI reference boards.

config OMAP_RESET_CLOCKS
	bool "Reset unused clocks during boot"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP
	help
	  Say Y if you want to reset unused clocks during boot.
	  This option saves power, but assumes all drivers are
	  using the clock framework. Broken drivers that do not
	  yet use clock framework may not work with this option.
	  If you are booting from another operating system, you
	  probably do not want this option enabled until your
	  device drivers work properly.

config OMAP_BOOT_TAG
	bool "OMAP bootloader information passing"
        depends on ARCH_OMAP
        default n
        help
          Say Y, if you have a bootloader which passes information
          about your board and its peripheral configuration.

config OMAP_BOOT_REASON
	bool "Support for boot reason"
        depends on OMAP_BOOT_TAG
        default n
        help
          Say Y, if you want to have a procfs entry for reading the boot
          reason in user-space.

config OMAP_COMPONENT_VERSION
	bool "Support for component version display"
	depends on OMAP_BOOT_TAG && PROC_FS
	default n
	help
	  Say Y, if you want to have a procfs entry for reading component
	  versions (supplied by the bootloader) in user-space.

config OMAP_GPIO_SWITCH
	bool "GPIO switch support"
        default n
        help
          Say Y, if you want to have support for reporting of GPIO
          switches (e.g. cover switches) via sysfs. Your bootloader has
          to provide information about the switches to the kernel via the
          ATAG_BOARD mechanism if they're not defined by the board config.

config OMAP_MUX
	bool "OMAP multiplexing support"
        depends on ARCH_OMAP
	default y
        help
          Pin multiplexing support for OMAP boards. If your bootloader
          sets the multiplexing correctly, say N. Otherwise, or if unsure,
          say Y.

config OMAP_MUX_DEBUG
	bool "Multiplexing debug output"
        depends on OMAP_MUX
        help
          Makes the multiplexing functions print out a lot of debug info.
          This is useful if you want to find out the correct values of the
          multiplexing registers.

config OMAP_MUX_WARNINGS
	bool "Warn about pins the bootloader didn't set up"
        depends on OMAP_MUX
        default y
        help
	  Choose Y here to warn whenever driver initialization logic needs
	  to change the pin multiplexing setup.  When there are no warnings
	  printed, it's safe to deselect OMAP_MUX for your product.

	  This enables a console driver by way of STI/XTI.

config OMAP_MCBSP
	bool "McBSP support"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here if you want support for the OMAP Multichannel
	  Buffered Serial Port.

config OMAP_MMU_FWK
	tristate "MMU framework support"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP

	  Say Y here if you want to use OMAP MMU framework support for
	  DSP, IVA1.0 and Camera in OMAP1/2.

	  Select this option if you want to use the OMAP mpu timer. This

	bool "Use 32KHz timer"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP16XX || ARCH_OMAP24XX
	select GENERIC_TIME
	select GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS
	help
	  Select this option if you want to enable the OMAP 32KHz timer.
	  This timer saves power compared to the OMAP_MPU_TIMER, and has
	  support for no tick during idle. The 32KHz timer provides less
	  intra-tick resolution than OMAP_MPU_TIMER. The 32KHz timer is
	  currently only available for OMAP16XX and 24XX.
