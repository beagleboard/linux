 *
 * This device tree serves to replace the need for an overlay when using
 * the RoboticsCape. It is similar to the boneblue tree but preserves
 * pin config for the black.
 *
 * This file was updated in April 2018 to support LED driver like in BB Blue
 * This goes in sync with V0.4.0 of the Robotics Cape library
